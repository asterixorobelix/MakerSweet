How to use the TSP solver

In terminal:
"./concorde myprob.tsp" (note that this will take a very long time if there are a large number of points in the tsp file.
18 000 points took many hours)

where myprob.tsp is a TSP instance in TSPLIB format.  

To test the concorde solver run "concorde -s 99 -k 100" (this should generate and
solve a random geometric TSP on 100 points).

Options:

-B : do not branch
-i : just solve the blossom polytope
-I : just solve the subtour polytope
-o f : output file name (for optimal tour)
-V : just run fast cuts
-w : just subtours and trivial blossoms
-x : delete files on completion

./concorde -B -V tspProb.tsp (very short run time, 40 seconds for 18 000 points)
./concorde -V tspProb.tsp (slightly longer run time, 43 seconds for 18 000 points)
./concorde -B tspProb.tsp (longer, 765 seconds for 18 000 points)
